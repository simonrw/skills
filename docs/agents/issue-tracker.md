# Issue tracker: GitHub

Issues and PRDs for this repo live as GitHub issues on `simonrw/skills`. Use the `gh` CLI for all operations.

## Conventions

- **Create an issue**: `gh issue create --title "..." --body "..."`. Use a heredoc for multi-line bodies.
- **Read an issue**: `gh issue view <number> --comments`, filtering comments by `jq` and also fetching labels.
- **List issues**: `gh issue list --state open --json number,title,body,labels,comments --jq '[.[] | {number, title, body, labels: [.labels[].name], comments: [.comments[].body]}]'` with appropriate `--label` and `--state` filters.
- **Comment on an issue**: `gh issue comment <number> --body "..."`
- **Apply / remove labels**: `gh issue edit <number> --add-label "..."` / `--remove-label "..."`
- **Close**: `gh issue close <number> --comment "..."`

Infer the repo from `git remote -v` — `gh` does this automatically when run inside a clone.

## Pull requests as a triage surface

**PRs as a request surface: no.** _(Set to `yes` if this repo treats external PRs as feature requests; `/triage` reads this flag.)_

When set to `yes`, PRs run through the same labels and states as issues, using the `gh pr` equivalents:

- **Read a PR**: `gh pr view <number> --comments` and `gh pr diff <number>` for the diff.
- **List external PRs for triage**: `gh pr list --state open --json number,title,body,labels,author,authorAssociation,comments` then keep only `authorAssociation` of `CONTRIBUTOR`, `FIRST_TIME_CONTRIBUTOR`, or `NONE` (drop `OWNER`/`MEMBER`/`COLLABORATOR`).
- **Comment / label / close**: `gh pr comment`, `gh pr edit --add-label`/`--remove-label`, `gh pr close`.

GitHub shares one number space across issues and PRs, so a bare `#42` may be either — resolve with `gh pr view 42` and fall back to `gh issue view 42`.

## When a skill says "publish to the issue tracker"

Create a GitHub issue.

## When a skill says "fetch the relevant ticket"

Run `gh issue view <number> --comments`.

## Wayfinding operations

Used by `/wayfinder`. The **map** is a single issue with **child** issues as tickets.

- **Map**: a single issue labelled `wayfinder:map`, holding the Destination / Notes / Decisions-so-far / Fog body. `gh issue create --label wayfinder:map`.
- **Child ticket**: an issue attached to the map as a native GitHub sub-issue. Native sub-issues are enabled on this repo: `gh api --method POST repos/simonrw/skills/issues/<map>/sub_issues -F sub_issue_id=<child-db-id>`, where `<child-db-id>` is the child's numeric **database id** (`gh api repos/simonrw/skills/issues/<n> --jq .id`, not the `#number` or `node_id`). Also put `Part of #<map>` at the top of the child body so the link is readable in plain text. Labels: `wayfinder:<type>` (`research`/`prototype`/`grilling`/`task`).
- **Blocking**: GitHub's native issue dependencies, which render in the UI. Add an edge with `gh api --method POST repos/simonrw/skills/issues/<child>/dependencies/blocked_by -F issue_id=<blocker-db-id>`, again using the database id. GitHub reports open blockers at `issue_dependencies_summary.blocked_by`, which is the live gate. Mirror the edge as a `Blocked by: #<n>, #<n>` line near the top of the child body for readability.
- **Frontier query**: list the map's open sub-issues, then drop any with `issue_dependencies_summary.blocked_by > 0` or an assignee. First in map order wins.
- **Claim**: `gh issue edit <n> --add-assignee @me` — the session's first write.
- **Resolve**: `gh issue comment <n> --body "<answer>"`, then `gh issue close <n>`, then append a context pointer (gist + link) to the map's Decisions-so-far.

**Assets** produced while resolving a ticket (research findings, prototypes) are files in the repo, linked from the issue rather than pasted into it. Research findings go under `.scratch/<effort>/research/`.
